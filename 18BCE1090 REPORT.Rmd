## **What problem are you trying to solve?**

### With this exploratory data analysis, upcoming startup restaurants which have an idea to partner with zomato can be aware of the factors that affect their business and also the improvements existing restaurants can make from the analysis.
### Some of the factors we will analyze are restaurant Location,Establishment,Cuisine Type,price range,reviews,customer votes,delivery and takeaway options.
### To find  people’s major favourite cuisines,taste and how it is differing from city to city.

## **Objectives**:


### 1.Cleaning and preprocessing the data to make it ready for Exploratory Data Analysis.

### 2.Analysing the restaurants based on numerous factors like establishments,locality,cusine types,timings,price range,ratings,votes,delivery options.
* Univariate Analysis on Overall Dataset
* Geo-Spatial Analysis on India.
* Univariate and Bivariate Analysis on Chennai and its locality
* Univariate Analysis on Mumbai
* Bivariate Analysis on top 10 cities of india.

### 3.Comparing customer's favourite cuisine type that are present among different cities.

### 4.Finding the price range that is suitable for customers among different cities.

### 5.Analysing the same restaurant's branch present in different locality and determining  the quality among them with the help of customer ratings.

### 6.Doing inferential statistics with the data(ANOVA TEST,Correlation test)

### 7.Also predicting whether a new restaurant can be successfull on partnering with zomato using Machine Learning models(i.e)to predict the suitable cost of the new restaurant based on the various factors

## **Is there any work previously reported on the problem and the data? If so, discuss it here.**

### ANSWER:There is only one analysis done before on the dataset I have selected and it is a very brief analysis on taking only a small subset of the dataset.The person has selected restaurants present only in Bangalore City and has  found the major restaurant establishments present,Localities with the maximum number of restaurant in Bangalore.

## **Cleaning the dataset**

### Removing duplicate data and columns that are not useful for Analysis
```{r}

df1=df[,-c(1,4,5,7,11,12,13,15,18)]
df1=unique(df1)
```
#### Here we removed restaurant id,restaurant url details,restaurant address,city id,zipcode,country id,locality verbose,currency


### Establishment Column

```{r}
df1%>%
distinct(establishment)

df1%>%
  summarise(ctnmiss=sum(is.na(establishment)))

df1=df1%>%
  mutate(establishment=gsub("\\[|\\]", "", establishment))

df1=df1%>%
  mutate(establishment=gsub("'", "", establishment))

df1=df1%>%
  mutate(establishment=gsub("Ã©", "e", establishment))

df1=df1%>%
  mutate(establishment=replace(establishment,establishment=="","Not Mentioned"))

df1%>%
  distinct(establishment)
```
#### There are 27 establishment type present in india.Here we find that there is no missing data but there are empty strings present which we replace to "Not Mentioned" and we can remove the brackets,special characters and quotation marks present.


### Cuisine 

```{r}
#df1%>%
 # distinct(cuisines)

#df1%>%
 # filter(cuisines=="")

df1%>%
  summarise(ctnmiss=sum(is.na(cuisines)))

df1=df1%>%
  mutate(cuisines=replace(cuisines,cuisines=="","Not Given"))

```
#### There are no missing values but there are empty string so we replace it to ""Not given"

### Average cost for two
```{r}
#df1%>%
 # distinct(average_cost_for_two)


table(df1$average_cost_for_two)

df1%>%
  summarise(ctnmiss=sum(is.na(average_cost_for_two)))
class(df1$average_cost_for_two)

#remove rows having average cost as 0
df1=df1%>%
  filter(average_cost_for_two!=0)



table(df1$average_cost_for_two)
```
#### There are some restaurants having average cost as 0 which is not useful for analysis.So we can remove these restaurants. 


### Highlights
```{r}
a=df1%>%
  select(highlights)
a[c(1:3),]


df1%>%
  summarise(ctnmiss=sum(is.na(highlights)))

#df1%>%
 # distinct(highlights)

df1=df1%>%
  mutate(highlights=replace(highlights,highlights=="","Highlights Not mentioned"))


df1=df1%>%
  mutate(highlights=gsub("\\[|\\]", "", highlights))

df1=df1%>%
  mutate(highlights=gsub("'", "", highlights))



```

#### Here we replace the empty strings present in Highlights column to "Highlights not mentioned".The brackets and quotation marks are also removed .




### Rating text
```{r}

df1%>%
  summarise(ctnmiss=sum(is.na(rating_text)))

df1%>%
  distinct(rating_text)

a=df1$aggregate_rating

df1$rating_text=ifelse(a==0,"Not Rated",
                ifelse(a>0 & a<2.5,"Poor",
                ifelse(a>=2.5 & a<3.5,"Average",
                ifelse(a>=3.5 & a<4,"Good",
                ifelse(a>=4 & a<4.5,"Very Good",
                ifelse(a>=4.5 & a<5,"Excellent",NA))))))

df1%>%
  summarise(ctnmiss=sum(is.na(rating_text)))

df1%>%
  distinct(rating_text)
```

#### There are no missing values in the column.But the column has rating text written in other languages apart from english.Since the rating text is based upon the aggregate rating column.We can change the data based upon the condition as :if rating is 0 the corresponding rating text is "Not Rated",if rating is between 0 and 2.5 it is "Poor" ,if the rating is between 2.5 and 3.5 it is "average",between 3.5 to 4 is "Good",between 4 to 4.5 is "Very Good",between 4.5 to 5 is "Excellent".


### Votes



```{r}
df1%>%
  summarise(ctnmiss=sum(is.na(votes)))

#df1%>%
#  distinct(votes)
a=df1%>%
  filter(votes<100)%>%
  distinct(votes)
a

boxplot(a$votes)


df1=df1%>%
  mutate(votes=replace(votes,votes==-3,0))%>%
  mutate(votes=replace(votes,votes==-18,0))


summary(df1$votes)
```
#### There are no missing values in votes column but there are outliers present in it,there are votes less than 0 which is not possible.So it is replaced by 0. 


### Opentable support

```{r}
df1%>%
  summarise(ctnmiss=sum(is.na(opentable_support)))
df1%>%
  distinct(opentable_support)

df1=df1%>%
  select(-(opentable_support))

dim(df1)

```
#### There is only one factor in opentable support which is not usefull for analysis so the column is removed.



### Delivery


```{r}
df1%>%
  summarise(ctnmiss=sum(is.na(delivery)))

df1%>%
  distinct(delivery)

table(df1$delivery)

 

rr=df1%>%
  filter(name=="Rasavid")%>%
  select(name,locality,delivery)

kable(rr, "html") %>% kable_styling("striped") %>% scroll_box(width = "100%") 

df1=df1%>%
  mutate(delivery=replace(delivery,delivery==0,1))

df1=unique(df1)
dim(df1)

table(df1$delivery)


```

#### There are no missing values.There are three factors present in delivery column they are -1,0 and 1 . -1 corresponds to not deliverable whereas 0 and 1 corresponds to deliverable.On looking at the restaurants having delivery as 0,the same restaurant names also have a row with delivery as 1.So clearly the rows with 0 are duplicated.So it is replaced with 1 to avoid redundancy and to make it simple for analysis.

### Takeaway

```{r}
df1%>%
  summarise(ctnmiss=sum(is.na(takeaway)))
df1%>%
  distinct(takeaway)

table(df1$takeaway)

df1=df1%>%
  select(-(takeaway))

dim(df1)
```
#### The takeaway columns have only 1 factor which is not usefull for analysis.So it is removed.

```{r}

sapply(df1,function(x) sum(is.na(x)))

```

## **Overall Analysis(INDIA)**

### **(i)Univariate Analysis on India**

### Loading Useful Package
```{r}

pkgs <- c( "data.table","RColorBrewer", "wesanderson", 
          "viridis", "ggplot2", "corrplot","dplyr","lattice","Hmisc","tidytext")

rc <- sapply(pkgs, function(x){
  library(package = x, character.only = T, logical.return = T)
}, simplify = F)


df=data.table(read.csv("zomatocleaned1.csv"))

```



## Based on City
### Cities and restaurant count

```{r}

#cites and their restaurant count
res_city <- dcast(df, city ~.)


names(res_city)[1] <- "City"
names(res_city)[2] <- "Count"


res_city <- res_city[order(Count, decreasing = T)]
res_city

```

#### **INFERENCE:**From the table we can see that Chennai city has the highest number of restaurants followed by Mumbai,Bangalore,Pune and others.


### Barplot on cities having more than 800 restaurants.
```{r}
a=res_city%>%
  filter(Count>800)


barplot(height = a$Count, names.arg = a$City, 
        col = rainbow(length(a$City)), main = "No. of restaurants per city",
         ylab = "frequency", las = 2)


```

#### **INFERENCE:**There are 22 cities having restaurants more than 800.Chennai,Mumbai and Bangalore have more than 2000 restaurants.

## Based on Establishment

### Barplot on number of restaurants by establishment type
```{r}

b=df%>%
  group_by(establishment)%>%
  summarise(Count=n())%>%
  arrange(desc(Count))

barplot(height = b$Count, names.arg = b$establishment , 
        col = rainbow(n = length(b$establishment)), 
        main = "No. of restaurants per Establishment"
        , ylab = "frequency", las = 2,cex.names = 0.7)

```

#### **INFERENCE:**From the barplot we can see that most of the restaurants in india are established as Quick Bites,Casual Dining.The least established types are shack,Cocktail Bar,Irani Cafe,Pop up.



## Based on Rating text

### No of restaurants by rating text


```{r}
cd=df%>%
  group_by(rating_text)%>%
  summarise(con=n())%>%
  arrange(desc(con))

ggplot(data=cd,mapping=aes(x=reorder(rating_text,-con),y=con))+geom_bar(stat = "identity",aes(fill=rating_text))

```


#### **INFERENCE:**We can see that majority of the restaurant have got "Good" as the rating followed by "Average","Very Good".There are almost 10000 restaurants have not got many aggregate ratings from the customers,Hence they have been marked as "Not Rated".Around 2500 restaurants have Excellent ratings and very few have poor ratings.

### Restaurants based on the ratings and city wise

```{r}

db=dcast(df,city~rating_text)
db
```

## Based on Aggregate ratings

```{r}

ggplot(df, aes(x = aggregate_rating)) + geom_histogram(col = "red", fill = "yellow")

```


#### **INFERENCE:** We can see from the histogram that many of the restaurants have aggregate rating as 0 which means these restaurants are not rated.Hence we will plot the histogram only for restaurants that are rated by the customers.


```{r}
df1=df%>%
  filter(aggregate_rating!=0)

ggplot(df1, aes(x = aggregate_rating)) + geom_histogram(col = "red", fill = "yellow",bins=32) 
densityplot(df1$aggregate_rating)

```


#### **INFERENCE:**From the Histogram and density plot we can see that majority of the rating scores are in the range of 3.6 to 4.2




## Based on price range

### Barplot on number of restaurants based on price range
```{r}
df$price_range=as.factor(df$price_range)

```

####  **INFERENCE:**Most of the restaurants are present in price range 1 which corresponds to cheap followed by 2,3 and 4 which corresponds to costly.


### Pie chart on price range distribution
```{r}

f=table(df$price_range)
f=as.data.frame.table(f)
f
lbls=c("I-","II-","III-","IV-")
pct=round(f$Freq/sum(f$Freq)*100)
lbls=paste(lbls,pct)
lbls=paste(lbls,"%",sep="")
pie(f$Freq,labels = lbls,col = rainbow(length(f$Var1)),radius =1 )


```

#### **INFERENCE:**We can see that 50% of the restaurants are in the price range 1.

### Delivery

```{r}

#Delivery
g=table(df$delivery)
g=as.data.frame.table(g)

lbls=c("No","Yes")
pct=round(g$Freq/sum(g$Freq)*100)
lbls=paste(lbls,pct)
lbls=paste(lbls,"%",sep="")

pie(g$Freq,labels=lbls,col=rainbow(length(g$Var1)),radius =1 )

```

#### **INFERENCE:**We can see that majority of the restaurants do not have delivery option.





## Based on Average cost for two

### Frequency distribution on average cost for two.

## **INFERENTIAL STATISTICS :**

### correlation plot with average cost for 2 ,aggregate ratings,votes and photocount
```{r}

M=cor(df[,c(7,10,12,13)])

corrplot(M)


```

#### **INFERENCE** Only Photo count and peoples votes is somewhat strongly correlated. From this we can infer that the restaurant which has more number of customers taking photos has higher number of people voting/liking the restaurant.This kind of relationship might be because of the promotion/offers these restaurants give to customers who vote and share photos with their friends.


### Correlation analysis using pearson method for photocount and votes of a restaurant
```{r}

df=df%>%
  filter(votes<20000)


ggplot(df,aes(x=votes,y=photo_count))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm")



cor.test(df$votes,df$photo_count,method = "pearson")



```





### ONE WAY ANOVA TEST-To check if there is a significant difference in the average cost for two based on rating text
```{r}

#DF1-RESTAURANTS IN TOP 5 CITIES

df1=df1%>%
  filter(average_cost_for_two<3500)



df1$rating_text=as.factor(df1$rating_text)
levels(df1$rating_text)

#if not ordered, it can be reordered as follows
df1$rating_text <- ordered(df1$rating_text,levels=c("Not Rated","Poor","Average","Good","Very Good","Excellent"))


#visualize the data
library(ggplot2)



library(ggpubr)                                             
ggboxplot(df1,x="rating_text",y="average_cost_for_two",color="rating_text",palette = c("red","green","blue","yellow","cyan","purple"))

#mean plots
#plot weight by group
#add error bars: mean_seW

ggline(df1,x="rating_text",y="average_cost_for_two",add = c("mean_se"))



res <- aov(average_cost_for_two~rating_text,data=df1)
summary(res)

TukeyHSD(res)



```

#### **INFERENCE**:Since the p value of anova test is less than 0.05 there is a significant difference in average cost for two based on rating text.From the tukeyHSD Test the only difference between Good and poor ratings is not significant with an adjusted p-value greater than 0.05. 






## **PREDICTIVE STATISTICS**:

### Regression analysis-Predicting the restaurant's average cost for 2 based on the various factors using multiple regression model.
```{r}

library(ggplot2)



df1=df1%>%
  select(-name,-locality,-cuisines,-timings,-highlights)


set.seed(123)
library(caret)

train_samples <- df1$average_cost_for_two %>%
  createDataPartition(p=0.8,list=FALSE)

#head(train_samples)
train <- df1[train_samples,]
test <- df1[-train_samples,]

#Building a multiple regression model

model <- lm(average_cost_for_two~.,data=train)


summary(model)

#Make predictions
pred <- model %>%
  predict(test)



R2 <- R2(pred,test$average_cost_for_two)
R2 #should be greater


```

#### **INFERENCE**:The prediction model gives an R2 score of 0.93
